          <h3>About Affordable Housing</h3>
          <p>
            Affordable housing is a growing issue of regional importance in our
            community.
            {'  '}
            In May, 2016, the City of Pittsburgh&rsquo;s Affordable Housing Task
            Force released{' '}
            <a href="https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/mayorpeduto/FinalReport_5_31_16.pdf">
              its report
            </a>{' '}
            to the Mayor and City Council. The report called for the creation of
            a centralized, publicly-accessible repository of affordable housing
            data to be hosted by the{' '}
            <a href="https://www.wprdc.org">
              Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center
            </a>
            . In addition to including lists of deed and income-restricted
            properties, the Task Force also sought to use data to track
            compliance, monitor housing conditions, and establish an
            &lsquo;early warning system&rsquo; when use restrictions change, or
            condition issues threaten overall affordability and family
            stability.
          </p>
          <p>
            To support this goal of using data to proactively monitor threats to
            affordability, the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center at the
            University of Pittsburgh and the{' '}
            <a href="https://cmucreatelab.org/">Carnegie Mellon CREATE Lab</a>{' '}
            partnered to develop a frequently-updated collection of data about
            subsidized properties in Allegheny County from approximately 20
            different databases provided by HUD and the Pennsylvania Housing
            Finance Agency (PHFA). This tool launched in April 2022 allows
            people to view data for a project, and filter the data to display a
            subset of properties including those with low inspection scores and
            those that may have their subsidies expire in coming years. Users of
            the data explorer are also able to create watch lists of properties
            whose affordability is at risk. Properties can be viewed on a map,
            with data associated with each property displayed on screen.

          <h3>About the Data</h3>
          <p>
            Data in this tool describing subsidized properties has been
            assembled from data shared by HUD and the Pennsylvania Housing
            Finance Agency. It includes data about subsidized properties from
            three major federal housing finance programs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              HUD&rsquo;s Multifamily Program supports the development and
              preservation of affordable housing units through direct subsidies,
              guaranteed loans and subsidized mortgages. Data we capture
              includes contracts for direct subsidy programs such as Section 8,
              202, and 811. We also capture data from HUD&rsquo;s
              insured/guaranteed mortgage programs, including 207, 213, 220,
              221(d)(4), 223(f), 223(a)(7), 231, 231, 234(d), 241(a), 542(b),
              542(c). More detailed information for each Multifamily Program is{' '}

            <li>
              The Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program is the most
              important resource for creating affordable housing in the United
              States today. The LIHTC program gives State and local
              LIHTC-allocating agencies (PHFA in Pennsylvania) the equivalent of
              approximately $8 billion in annual budget authority to issue tax
              credits for the acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction
              of rental housing targeted to lower-income households. We capture
              LIHTC data from both HUD and PHFA.
            </li>
            <li>
              HUD&rsquo;s Public Housing program is managed by local Public
              Housing Agencies, including the Allegheny County Housing
              Authority, Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, and the
              McKeesport Housing Authority. Typically units in this program are
              owned and managed by these agencies.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            No single table with property information exists across these three
            programs. Each program has their own table and ID system, even if it
            all refers to what many would consider the same project or property.
            Data is not necessarily captured by what most people consider to be
            properties or projects. Data can describe buildings, contracts,
            subsidized loans, or mortgages associated with a property or
            development, or developments themselves. To add to the complexity,
            some projects can also receive a mix of funding from one or more of
            these programs. For example, a project may have one or more
            subsidies from the HUD multifamily program, and/or support from
            LIHTC.
          </p>
          <p>
            To create a linkage across these different programs, we created a
            master &ldquo;property&rdquo; index enabling us to allocate data
            from these three programs to what many would consider a project.
            While some projects have units scattered across multiple sites, we
            currently represent each using only one address.
          </p>
          <p>
            HUD publishes their data online, but there is no consistency in
            their approach. The data is shared in different locations, using
            different file formats ranging from Excel, MS Access, and
            CSV&rsquo;s. Some of the same data is even published in multiple
            locations. We initially tried to merge data from these different
            sources into one dataset, but found a few discrepancies between
            sources. For this reason, we made the decision to present the data
            as it is made available, leaving the user to identify and interpret
            potential discrepancy between sources.

            Members of the Preservation Working Group have helped design filters
            that can be used to identify properties that may be at risk of
            losing their subsidies. The filters included in this tool allow
            users to:

              Identify HUD Multifamily properties whose contracts may soon
              expire, or whose guaranteed loans will reach maturity. These
              expirations are typically measured by dates in each of the
              datasets.
