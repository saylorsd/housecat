            This tool was developed to provide people with information about
            communities and properties that can be used to expand and preserve
            affordable housing in Allegheny County. This document describes the
            terms of use that are designed to minimize the ability for actors in
            the housing market to use this data to act in a malicious or
            predatory fashion, and work counter to the mission of the
            Preservation Working Group
